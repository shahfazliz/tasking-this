# Task Management for ADHD

This is a personal project aimed at managing tasks for individuals with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using the Eisenhower 4 quadrants approach. The goal is to create a minimalistic task management tool that helps to prioritize tasks and maintain focus.

## Setting up the Environment Variables

To access the database for this project, you need to set up the following environment variables:

```bash
    TTDBHOST="<database ip address>"
    TTDBUSERNAME="<username>"
    TTDBPASSWORD="<password>"
```

## Running the Project

To start the project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
    npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and you should be able to access the task management tool in your browser.

## Eisenhower 4 Quadrants

The Eisenhower 4 quadrants is a productivity matrix that helps to prioritize tasks based on their urgency and importance. Tasks are divided into four categories:

1. Urgent and important
2. Important, but not urgent
3. Urgent, but not important
4. Not urgent or important

By focusing on tasks in the first two categories and limiting time spent on tasks in the latter two categories, individuals with ADHD can maintain focus and avoid distractions.
